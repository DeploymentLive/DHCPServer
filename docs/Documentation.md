Open source managed ipv4 DHCP server implementation, written in C#. With extensive support for DHCP options it is ideally suited for configuring and netbooting local systems such as PLCs and blade racks. 

Please NOTE: for now, the DHCP server itself is complete and I have it running in a production environment. However, due to time constraints the front-end (user interface) is still missing a nice way of adding and configuring the DHCP options. I will fix this as soon as possible.
